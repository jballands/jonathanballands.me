**Kinesis** is my "blog".

I put "blog" in inverted commas because, unlike a standard Wordpress or Ghost blog, Kinesis
is written from the ground up for my personal website. It uses cool technologies like
[React](https://reactjs.org/) and [D3](https://d3js.org/).

The cool part is what Kinesis allows me to do that's different from what everyone else can do.

## Seemless Browsing

Instead of a landing page that only shows you blog snippets, Kinesis uses a **sidebar** to help
you navigate.

When you open up Kinesis for the first time, the sidebar is open on the left-side of the screen.
This is where you can search for posts, organize posts by date, and choose posts to view.

When you choose a post, the sidebar collapses into "reader mode" so that it doesn't distract you.
To open the sidebar again, just click the "expand" button.

If the sidebar is open and you want it to go away, click the "collapse" button.

If you see a little eye-icon next to a post, it means you are currently viewing that post.

## Rich Content

Most CMS' only allow you to post content that is compatible with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).
Kinesis supports Markdown, but it also supports the use of pure React components. 

Too technical? Not only can I post articles to Kinesis, but I can also create rich, interactive experiences 
that help tell a story.

Basically, my blog is better than your blog.
