Oh hey. It's been a while since I've updated this thing. And I guess I have a blog now.

Believe it or not, this is the [third iteration](https://github.com/jballands/jonathanballands.me) of my website. I
started work on this verison in April 2017, and I had to work on it somewhere between work, finding a house, social life, etc.


[Somehow, I did it.](https://medium.com/@bengbutler/sleep-success-social-life-can-you-really-only-pick-two-ac6bd7e63edf)

I'm going to brag a bit about how this version of my site was developed, as well as how I overcame a few challenges along
the way. I might have gone a _little_ crazy with it, but I found going through the entire design/development process
on a personal site provided a good, low-risk environment to practice.

I also found this was a good exercise at practicing what I call Rational Design Decisionsâ„¢ (RDD). More on this soon.

# v3 is "Designed"

So, technically I designed v2 as well, but I feel as though I encountered a lot more obstacles in v3, and therefore
it warranted a lot more RDD to pull it off. Sometimes designing a good website involves more than just throwing 
[a bunch of gradients and using Helvetica everywhere](https://jonyiveredesignsthings.tumblr.com/).

Let's take a look at the initial design for [Kinesis](/kinesis/what-is-kinesis).

As you can see, it looks nothing like the final product. (If you didn't already know, this website you're looking at is
the final version.) Let's talk about what's wrong with this version, from a design perspective.

Firstly, I don't know about you, but it looks quite ugly and unbalanced. Half the page is devoted to a small number of
controls that you only care about 10% of the time while reading through a blog.
