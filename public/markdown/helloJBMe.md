Oh hey. I guess I have a blog now.

Believe it or not, this is the [third iteration](https://github.com/jballands/jonathanballands.me) of my personal website.
Since I started working on this thing in April 2017, I wanted my website to satisfy a the following personal goals:

1. v3 needs to be pretty
2. v3 needs to be cheaper
3. v3 needs to run on React
4. v3 needs to be me

I put a lot of thought and care into satisifing each bullet point, and I figured as a post-mortem exercise, why not talk bout what
I learned along the way. That sounds fun, right?

# v3 Is Pretty

# v3 Saves Money

The [previous verison](https://github.com/jballands/jonathanballands.me.old) of my website required a full Node server and
Mustache template rendering, which means I had to fork over $7 a money to Heroku to host it. Needless to say, this was overkill.

This verison is known as a single-page application, or a SPA. It renders using only HTML, CSS, and Javascript with no server-side
rendering required. This leads me to the next biggest change about my new website...

# v3 Runs on React

ðŸŽ‰

# v3 Doesn't Use Wordpress, Ghost, etc.
